# Story Ideas
A place to collect plans and ideas of various kinds.

- A story about/introducing Ari *Senshi?* and, by
  extension Ari's realm. Setup Ari as a
  multi-realm traveller.

- A story about a merchant in the Land of Heroes who goes on a
  small treasure hunt and stumbles upon an ancient shrine
  dedicated to a war god. (this could be a story in itself, but
  could also be the intro to a larger arc where a war against
  the war god occurs, like a giant boss battle)

- A wandering person in the post-catastrophy Realm (see below)
  learns about their world, stopping every once in a while to
  play their instrument (slice of life, allows focus on
  worldbuilding)

- Warrior and his master defend a small village in Ari's realm
  from an evil demon-summoning clan.

- Powerful cult in the Land of Heroes discovers that the other
  Realms exist and find out a way to open wormholes between
  them. Ari (plus maybe a faction of "interdimensional police"?)
  must destroy the cult before they invade all of the Realms.
  (This would come later in Ari's story. There could be all
  kinds of fights resulting from the "Rift", like LoH dragons
  and monsters coming into Ari's Realm or something.)

- Slice of life (kinda) about someone (probably queer) living a
  cozy life in the city realm ("my ideal life"-ish)

- A realm that is a fantasy world after catastrophic event that
  leaves few people left in the world, most of them in
  settlements that are few and far between (inspired by Yokohama
  Kaidashi Kikou). There may be a few travellers/wanderers on
  the road, but certainly not many. Nature has begun to take over
  all of the old human strucutres, creating a neat blend of
  modernism and nature. (not a story idea, but a realm idea)
