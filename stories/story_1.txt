Story 1 (untitled)

Title options:

================================================================
Setting:
- Rea
	- Rea is a land covered with golden forests, lakes,
	  mountains, and the occasional settlement or ocean. At
	  least, one half of it is. The way Rea orbits around its
	  star, only half of the planet ever sees the sun. The other
	  half lives in perpetual shadow, and died a long time ago.
	  Filled with monsters, darkness, and infinite night, no
	  Rean has ever seen the dark side and survived.
	- Magic is prevalent in Rea, with even the most basic
	  commoner knowing a spell or two. Each individual has their
	  own spiritual/magical force that they pull from when they
	  use magic. Magic is very abstract, and can be used to do
	  almost anything, though it requires some decent skill to
	  do so.
	- Long ago, an ancient clan discovered that magic casting
	  could be refined by channeling it through markings made
	  on a caster's body. Eventually, this became an art of its
	  own, and each settlement has a tattoist who creates a
	  unique tattoo on each settlement member's body. This
	  tattoo is only created after the person's magic has
	  manifested, showing its unique shape, like a fingerprint.
	  The tattoo artist models the tattoo after this
	  manifestation, making each tattoo a reflection of the
	  recipient's magical energy.

Characters (+ design/notes):
- Ari Edea (protagonist)
	General notes:
	- Uses the magic of the 6 elements, but has only mastered
	  two (still an impressive feat)
	- Comes from a small tribe relatively distanced from normal
	  Rean society
	  spellcasters in the tribe
	- Parents are still alive (crazy that we have to specify
	  that, but considering how many protagonists are 
	  orphans...)

	Personality:
	- A strong community member who loves her tribe and helps
	  them out when she can
	- Despite her attatchment to her community, she can't help
	  but wonder what life outside of their little encampment/
	  village would be like
	- Has very little/no interest in romantic or sexual
	  relationships
	- Has trained extensively in magic and, because of her rural
	  background, has good survival skills
	- Intelligent and a fast learner - the kind of person who
	  would learn multiple languages quickly
	- Aroace (like me!)

	Appearance:
	- Female
	- Late teens (17 or 18)
	- Dark brown hair - as her magic begins to get more powerful,
	  it gains a red sheen (glows when casting? - something like
	  that)
	- Average weight, with some decently defined muscles (but
	  that's to be expected, living in a group of forest
	  warriors)
	- Has a fire tatoo reaching up from her wrist to her
	  shoulder, with an arcane circle on her palm
	- Often wears a light, casual robe made of shimmery red/orange
	  material (she made it herself)

- Iired Ediaor (teacher/mentor)
	General notes:
	- Comes from Rea as well, but doesn't visit very often due to
	  past conflicts (plus, they might be recognized)
	- Has trained for many years, even after their teacher left,
	  and have developed reality manipulation powers that would
	  be highly regarded even by past travellers
	- Has also trained in Rean magic during their time in Rea,
	  but not the 6 elements like Ari

	Personality:
	- Non-Binary (they/them)
	- Enjoys what they do in the Realms, but is ready to move on
	- Have gotten bored of being the traveller, and are content
	  with their contributions
	- Is not completely on board with some of the traditions
	  regarding the traveller, and aims to change things when
	  they train Ari
	- Very mindful; takes their time before they speak,
	  meditates daily, and knows how to phrase words to get
	  their point across clearly (something I will need to
	  practice lol)
	- Does not take strong opinions on most topics, and is
	  indifferent to things that they don't care about
	
	Appearance:
	- While Iired's physical appearance doesn't change (at least
	  not very often), their outfit changes daily, and they have
	  clothing from each of the Realms, which they often cycle
	  through based on what mood they are in
	- Outfits share a commanlity in color; they are all shades of
	  light gray or white
	- Hair and eye color is also a reflection of their mood (they
	  don't have set colors for their moods, if it comes up in
	  writing just pick a color in the moment)
	- Shoulder length, semi-curly hair
	- Medium build, muscular, could clearly hold their own in a
	  fight
	- Tattoo of the sun on their back that they channel their
	  magic through

Plot (bullet points, significant events):

================================================================
Notes:
- Should be broken up into several chapters (2-5), so that the
  story is short, but not too short
- This story describes Ari as a young person, their lifestyle,
  etc. After introducing us to Ari and Rea, the story
  will shift to a narrative about how Ari learned about the
  other Realms, and was taught to be an interdimensional
  traveller.
- Traditionally, there can only be one interdimensional
  traveller at a time. This traveller's purpose is to protect
  all of the Realms from serious, universe-ending threat. This
  doesn't neccessarily include world ending villains and such,
  as heroes often rise within their worlds to stop them.
- The person who teaches Ari about the Realms is the last
  interdimensional traveller. They teach Ari how to travel
  between the Realms, extrasensory stuff, how to tell if a
  Realm is in danger, etc. Ari already knows basic magic, as
  they were born into a special clan. They can harness the
  6 elements of humanity, etc. The person (henceforth known as
  "Iired" chose Ari not just because Ari was born into
  this special clan, but because they show special care in
  the little things of the world, and their dedication to
  something once they put their mind to it.
- While Ari already has a good grasp on magic, being able to
  travel to and learn from the other Realms could make them
  the most adept magic user in all of the Realms (unlock max
  potential kinda thing)
- Iired could be someone close to Ari, like the person
  who taught them magic or something ("i have been watching
  the clan, and you're the best candidate" kind of thing).
- Iired could want to break the tradition of only one IT
  (interdimensional traveller), and informs Ari of the
  tradition, but instructs them to build a team or army of
  people to help defend the Realms. This could come with the
  diclosing of info of the Realm's existance to each Realm,
  therefore letting the "secret" out, but allowing people
  from any Realm to take part in the force (this would be
  an interesting arc, but kinda ruins some of the mystery
  of the place). Ultimately, at the end of training, once Iired
  is gone, Ari must make the choice whether or not to do this.
- A possible point of conflict (contributes to overall conflict)
  could be that Ari could seldom return to Rea due to the
  potential recognition by the citizens.
- When training Ari, Iired also gets outfits from each of the 
  Realms for her, so she can blend in. She still prefers wearing
  her handmade robe though.
