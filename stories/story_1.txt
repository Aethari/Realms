Notes:
- Should be broken up into several chapters (2-5), so that the
  story is short, but not too short
- This story describes Ari as a young person, their lifestyle,
  etc. After introducing us to Ari and Ari's Realm, the story
  will shift to a narrative about how Ari learned about the
  other Realms, and was taught to be an interdimensional
  traveller.
- Traditionally, there can only be one interdimensional
  traveller at a time. This traveller's purpose is to protect
  all of the Realms from serious, universe-ending threat. This
  doesn't neccessarily include world ending villains and such,
  as heroes often rise within their worlds to stop them.
- The person who teaches Ari about the Realms is the last
  interdimensional traveller. They teach Ari how to travel
  between the Realms, extrasensory stuff, how to tell if a
  Realm is in danger, etc. Ari already knows basic magic, as
  they were born into a special clan. They can harness the
  6 elements of humanity, etc. The person (henceforth known as
  "the Teacher" chose Ari not just because Ari was born into
  this special clan, but because they show special care in
  the little things of the world, and their dedication to
  something once they put their mind to it.
- While Ari already has a good grasp on magic, being able to
  travel to and learn from the other Realms could make them
  the most adept magic user in all of the Realms (unlock max
  potential kinda thing)
- The Teacher could be someone close to Ari, like the person
  who taught them magic or something ("i have been watching
  the clan, and you're the best candidate" kind of thing).
- The Teacher could want to break the tradition of only one IT
  (interdimensional traveller), and informs Ari of the
  tradition, but instructs them to build a team or army of
  people to help defend the Realms. This could come with the
  diclosing of info of the Realm's existance to each Realm,
  therefore letting the "secret" out, but allowing people
  from any Realm to take part in the force (this would be
  an interesting arc, but kinda ruins some of the mystery
  of the place). Ultimately, at the end of training, once the
  Teacher is gone, Ari must make the choice whether or not to
  do this.
