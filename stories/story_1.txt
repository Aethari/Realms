Setting:
- Rea
	- Rea is a land covered with golden forests, lakes,
	  mountains, and the occasional settlement or ocean. At
	  least, one half of it is. The way Rea orbits around its
	  star, only half of the planet ever sees the sun. The other
	  half lives in perpetual shadow, and died a long time ago.
	  Filled with monsters, darkness, and infinite night, no
	  Rean has ever seen the dark side and survived.
	- Magic is prevalent in Rea, with even the most basic
	  commoner knowing a spell or two. Each individual has their
	  own spiritual/magical force that they pull from when they
	  use magic. Magic is very abstract, and can be used to do
	  almost anything, though it requires some decent skill to
	  do so.
	- Long ago, an ancient clan discovered that magic casting
	  could be refined by channeling it through markings made
	  on a caster's body. Eventually, this became an art of its
	  own, and each settlement has a tattoist who creates a
	  unique tattoo on each settlement member's body. This
	  tattoo is only created after the person's magic has
	  manifested, showing its unique shape, like a fingerprint.
	  The tattoo artist models the tattoo after this
	  manifestation, making each tattoo a reflection of the
	  recipient's magical energy.

Notes:
- Should be broken up into several chapters (2-5), so that the
  story is short, but not too short
- This story describes Ari as a young person, their lifestyle,
  etc. After introducing us to Ari and Rea, the story
  will shift to a narrative about how Ari learned about the
  other Realms, and was taught to be an interdimensional
  traveller.
- Traditionally, there can only be one interdimensional
  traveller at a time. This traveller's purpose is to protect
  all of the Realms from serious, universe-ending threat. This
  doesn't neccessarily include world ending villains and such,
  as heroes often rise within their worlds to stop them.
- The person who teaches Ari about the Realms is the last
  interdimensional traveller. They teach Ari how to travel
  between the Realms, extrasensory stuff, how to tell if a
  Realm is in danger, etc. Ari already knows basic magic, as
  they were born into a special clan. They can harness the
  6 elements of humanity, etc. The person (henceforth known as
  "the Teacher" chose Ari not just because Ari was born into
  this special clan, but because they show special care in
  the little things of the world, and their dedication to
  something once they put their mind to it.
- While Ari already has a good grasp on magic, being able to
  travel to and learn from the other Realms could make them
  the most adept magic user in all of the Realms (unlock max
  potential kinda thing)
- The Teacher could be someone close to Ari, like the person
  who taught them magic or something ("i have been watching
  the clan, and you're the best candidate" kind of thing).
- The Teacher could want to break the tradition of only one IT
  (interdimensional traveller), and informs Ari of the
  tradition, but instructs them to build a team or army of
  people to help defend the Realms. This could come with the
  diclosing of info of the Realm's existance to each Realm,
  therefore letting the "secret" out, but allowing people
  from any Realm to take part in the force (this would be
  an interesting arc, but kinda ruins some of the mystery
  of the place). Ultimately, at the end of training, once the
  Teacher is gone, Ari must make the choice whether or not to
  do this.
